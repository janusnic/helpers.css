# helpers.css


## Intro

**Helpers.css** is a very tiny CSS library (minified to less than 4KB) that aims to speed up writing HTML and CSS code while solving some fundamental problems when dealing with the LTR (Left-to-Right) and RTL (Right-to-Left) versions of a website.  

Helpers.css was originally developed at eTobb INC and was later open sourced on GitHub after our dev team realized how useful it is.  

We started using helpers.css in the V2 of [eTobb.com](http://www.eTobb.com) and we still use it in all our internal projects.  


## Source

The main file that should be included is [helpers.css](https://github.com/JadJoubran/helpers.css/blob/master/src/helpers.css)  
The RTL file should be only included (after the main file) in the RTL version of your website (if any) [rtl.helpers.css](https://github.com/JadJoubran/helpers.css/blob/master/src/rtl.helpers.css)
